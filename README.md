# Exact diagonalization of pure $\bathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory in $(2+1)$d

The goal of this project is to perform practical resolution of a quantum field theory on the lattice, through the method of exact diagonalization. The pure $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory in $(2+1)$ has been chosen for this demonstration, since it presents many of the interesting aspects of gauge theories but remains simple enough to be exact diagonalized. We take advantage of the gauge invariance of the theory to greatly simplify the problem, with a set of considerations that can be generalized to even more complicated gauge theories.

This notebook contains the tools to perform the exact diagonalization, and provides examples of analysis of the energy spectrum and time evolution of some observables in the theory.
